Hi I'm Bernhard, and I've been programming since roughly 8 years professionally. On this blog I want to share interesting problems, solutions and other things I encounter during my daily life. This is currently mostly an exercise to solidify my own understanding of those concepts and problems, because the best way to truely understand something is to explain it to somone else. So that is the purpose of this blog, my own web based rubber duck and maybe sometime somewhere someone finds it useful as well.
